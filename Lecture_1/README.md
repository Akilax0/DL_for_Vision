# Lecture 1: Introduction

Computer Vision -> Bulding artifical systems that process, preceive, and reason about visual data

Cameras all around us. 

Learning -> Building artifical systems that learn from data and experience.

Deep Learning -> Heirarchical learning algos with many "layers" loosley from brain.

## Agenda

- brief history of computer vision and deep learning 


Hubel and Wiesel, 1959
