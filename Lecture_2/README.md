# Lecture 2 - Image Classification


Image Classification: A core computer vision task

input : image 
output: assign image to one of a fixed set of categories

Problem : Semantic gap 
what computer sees is a big grid of numbers 0,255

Challleges: Viewpoint Variation
All pixels change when camera moves

Interclass Variation

Fine-Grained Categories -> different breeds of cats

Background Clutter 

Illuminiation Changes 

Deformation -> various positions

Occlusion -> hidden

## Useful:
    Medical 
    Galaxy 
    Whale

    Object detection : image classification is a subtask of this 

    Image Captioning

    Playing Go

## Image Classifier

no obvious way to hard-code algo for detecting cats

can try with edge detection then find corners ?

-- but different challenges make this not robust


## Machine Learning : Data Driven Approach

    1. Collect a dataset of images and labels
    2. Use Machine Learning to train a classifier
    3. Evaluate the classifier on new images
